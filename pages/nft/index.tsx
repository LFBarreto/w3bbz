              A collection of 99 Tetris card games fully on chain, unique in rarity and traits.

              This is also a battle royale game fully on chain, 
              giving you a chance to win a price just by owning a token.
  
              This NFT project builds on the previous space invader one.
              during transfer the Token evolves and takes a new shape
              both in data as well as visual.
